[#common_module_coffee-module-redisstream]
= coffee-module-redisstream

Module designed to support the increasingly popular stream in the personification of Redis.
Redis Stream is a new feature that was added to Redis 5+.
It combines the classic Redis publisher/subscriber functionality with the JMS queue needs,
providing an alternative solution to replace JMS.
The concept description can be found at https://redis.io/topics/streams-intro[Redis streams-intro],
from which this implementation was derived, with the addition of enterprise requirements. 

== RedisConnection

The coffee-module-redisstream module uses the <<coffee-module-redis>> module for Redis connection management.
The Redis connection setup is the same as described for <<coffee-module-redis>>,
it is based on the "key" there, only through its own annotation class,
which also allows other stream settings.

NOTE: with the current jedis version 4.2.1, Redis compatibility is backwards to 2.8.x

== Message and content

Since the implementation uses the jedis driver,
so there is a restriction on the format in which the
general message frame.
Normally this is an XSD which is part of an API,
but now, due to the specificity of the driver (`redis.clients.jedis.StreamEntry` object is the carrier), these are just keys.
These keys are called
`hu.icellmobilsoft.coffee.module.redisstream.config.IRedisStreamConstant.Common`
interface:

* *_message_* - business content of redis stream message.
This is preferably mostly a *String ID (DB PK)* for some data,
*or* if the need is more complicated, a *JSON* referring to a custom API.
You should aim to keep them to a minimum,
contain "reusable" structures.
Of course, business needs do not always allow this,
but practice tells us that in most cases only one identifier is used.
* *_ttl_* - redis stream message expiry time in Long epoch millisec format.
So a timestamp that will tell the consumer when it expires and
then the consumer just ACKs the message without processing the content. 
* hu.icellmobilsoft.coffee.dto.common.LogConstants.LOG_SESSION_ID pointer (*"_extSessionId_"*) -
The "process identifier" in the system,
which can be linked beyond the rest input and asynch message operations.
** Attention must be paid to "uniqueness" when training the value,
especially when 1 process forks into N asynch processes.
This is the case of failower jobs for example,
so the original process identifier must be supplemented with a new unique identifier.
Expect the possibility of several such levels.
This is done by the `StreamMessageParameter.FLOW_ID_EXTENSION` (*"_flowIdExtension_"*) variable in the system,
currently only used for redis streams.

When browsing Redis content, this may look like this:

.sample of simple content:
[source,json]
----
{
  "extSessionId": "3OXV5ZUSUAF1KA8G_3OCISPU2RW0NWR7M",
  "flowIdExtension": "3OCISPU2RW0NWR7M",
  "message": "sample-10415900/2022-01/",
  "ttl": "1646381700045"
}
----
The value of `extSessionId` here is already seen to be a "composite" process identifier,
where "3OXV5ZUSUAF1KA8G" is the original process ID,
and then appended with "3OCISPU2RW0NWR7M" which is the unique identifier of the asynch.
When browsing the logs, you can then clearly see where the process is split.

.sample for more complex content:
[source,json]
----
{
  "extSessionId": "#TEST-SimpleTest5546-3OW013B5CP8CMH07_3OW013Z1JLNPOP09",
  "message": {
    "blacklisted": false,
    "changeDate": "2022-03-03T01:50:38.035812+01:00",
    "identifier": "3OW01426SX6BP5KW",
    "inputDate": "2022-03-02T23:00:00Z",
    "version": 0
  },
  "ttl": "1646268938291"
}
----
The `message` shown here is a more complex message content,
should belong somewhere in the API (XSD) and JSON format is recommended to use.

[#common_module_coffee-module-redisstream-config]
== Configuration

Configuration is done via the `@RedisStreamConsumer` and `@RedisStreamProducer` qualifiers.
Configuration in yaml:

.yaml config file
[source,yaml]
----
coffee:
   redisstream:
       sampleGroup: #<1>
           stream:
               read:
                   timeoutmillis: 60000 #default: 60000 <2>
           producer:
               maxlen: 10000 #default none <3>
               ttl: 300000 #millisec, default none <4>
           consumer:
               threadsCount: 2 #default: 1 <5>
               retryCount: 2 #default: 1 <6>
               manualAck: true # default: false <7>
----
<1> Unique name of the stream group. All fields are optional.
<2> Stream consumer timeout - how long to wait for the message in 1 iteration.
If no message is received in the stream for this number of ms,
it will close the connection and reopen a new connection in a new iteration.
<3> Maximum size of stream messages.
Each time a new message is inserted, it deletes older messages from the stream,
even if they have or have not been processed.
<4> (Coff:ee 1.6.0+) Stream message expiration time.
On inserting each new message, discard older messages from the stream,
even if they have or have not been processed.
<5> The number of independent threads to start in a given group (sampleGroup) consumer.
<6> (Coff:ee 1.4.0+) The number of times the given group (sampleGroup) consumer should retry on `BaseException`.
For other errors not resulting from `BaseException` this setting is ignored.
<7> If true, an explicit `XACK` call is required at the end of message processing.
If an exception is thrown during processing, this is omitted and the message can be reprocessed manually.
If false, then an automatic ack occurs already during message processing. Default: `false`.
See redis https://redis.io/commands/xreadgroup/[XREADGROUP documentation]:
[quote]
____
The NOACK subcommand can be used to avoid adding the message to the PEL in cases where reliability is not a requirement
and the occasional message loss is acceptable. This is equivalent to acknowledging the message when it is read.
____

WARNING: When specifying `...producer.maxlen` and `...producer.ttl` at the same time
the parameter `...producer.ttl` will not be taken into account!

This includes an EE level setting,
which is needed if the default is not enough to start extra threads (e.g. maximum thread count).
These settings vary by application server, e.g:

* Wildfly 21:

** use https://docs.wildfly.org/21/Developer_Guide.html#managed-executor-service 
** configuration https://docs.wildfly.org/21/Admin_Guide.html#managed-executor-services

* Thorntail 2.7:

** configuration https://docs.thorntail.io/2.7.0.Final/#_ee

.MDC
The system logs at MDC level as "retryCounter",
the number of iterations of the retry
(`coffee.redisstream.sampleGroup.consumer.retryCount` configuration).

=== RedisStreamService

All Redis stream operations are handled by the
`hu.icellmobilsoft.coffee.module.redisstream.service.RedisStreamService`
class.
If needed, it can be accessed directly via CDI,
but it is more practical to use the classes created for _Producer_ and _Consumer_.

=== Producer

To send messages to a stream, use the
`hu.icellmobilsoft.coffee.module.redisstream.publisher.RedisStreamPublisher`
class, such as:

[source,java]
----
@Inject
@RedisStreamProducer(configKey = "streamConfigKey", group = "streamGroup") //<1>
private RedisStreamPublisher redisStreamPublisher;
...
redisStreamPublisher.publish("message"); //<2>
// or
redisStreamPublisher.publish("alternativeGroup", "message");
redisStreamPublisher.publish(List.of("message-1", "message-2"));
redisStreamPublisher.publish("alternativeGroup", List.of("message-1", "message-2"));
redisStreamPublisher.publishPublications(List.of(
        RedisStreamPublication.of("group-1", "message-1"),
        RedisStreamPublication.of("group-2", "message-2")
// parameterization of the message
long expiry = Instant.now().plus(5, ChronoUnit.MINUTES).toEpochMilli();
Map<String, String> map = Map.ofEntries(RedisStreamPublisher.parameterOf(StreamMessageParameter.TTL, expiry));
redisStreamPublisher.publish("message", parameters); //<3>

// or
RedisStreamPublication publication = RedisStreamPublication.of(id).withTTL(defaultTTL).withParameter(StreamMessageParameter.FLOW_ID_EXTENSION, id))
redisStreamPublisher.publishPublication(publication); //<4>
----
<1> "group" is not mandatory in all cases
<2> The "message" content itself will be stored in a kind of coffee stream message structure,
which is the key of `IRedisStreamConstant.Common.DATA_KEY_MESSAGE`.
The message itself is supplemented with extra information, such as a process identifier.
<3> It is also possible to specify custom project specific parameters.
The options provided by the system are described in `hu.icellmobilsoft.coffee.module.redisstream.config.StreamMessageParameter`
enum class
<4> `RedisStreamPublication` plays an all-in-one role in the message sending process,
parameters set override the _group_ set in `redisStreamPublisher`.

TIP: Each `publish` call is made on a separate Jedis connection, so given
In some cases, you may want to collect the messages and pass them as a list.

.RedisStreamPublication
If you need to submit several messages at once, you may want to use the
`hu.icellmobilsoft.coffee.module.redisstream.publisher.RedisStreamPublication` class,
which is prepared to add its own parameters to each message,
or even send messages to other streams,
than what happens with the `RedisStreamPublisher` inject.

Examples are:

* `StreamMessageParameter.TTL` - Message expiry time
* `StreamMessageParameter.FLOW_ID_EXTENSION` - Role to complement the SID logging
for easier browsing of logs
* + other custom settings

=== Consumer

Use SampleConsumer for the above config:

.IRedisStreamConsumer.class
[source,java]
----
package hu.icellmobilsoft.redis.consume;

import javax.enterprise.context.Dependent;
import javax.inject.Inject;

import hu.icellmobilsoft.coffee.dto.exception.BaseException;
import hu.icellmobilsoft.coffee.module.redisstream.annotation.RedisStreamConsumer;
import hu.icellmobilsoft.coffee.module.redisstream.consumer.IRedisStreamConsumer;
import hu.icellmobilsoft.coffee.se.logging.Logger;
import hu.icellmobilsoft.sample.requestScope.Counter;
import hu.icellmobilsoft.sample.dependent.CounterDependent;
import hu.icellmobilsoft.sample.applicationScope.CounterApplication;
import redis.clients.jedis.StreamEntry;

@Dependent
@RedisStreamConsumer(configKey = "redisConfigKey", group = "sampleGroup")
public class SampleConsumer implements IRedisStreamConsumer {

    @Inject
    private Logger log;

    @Inject
    private Counter counter; // <1>

    @Inject
    private CounterDependent counterDependent; // <2>

    @Inject
    private CounterApplication counterApplication; // <3>

    @Override
    public void onStream(StreamEntry streamEntry) throws BaseException {
        log.info("Processing streamEntry [{0}]", streamEntry);
        counter.print();
        counterDependent.print();
        counterApplication.print();
    }
}
----
<1> The Counter class works in RequestScope
<2> The CounterDependent class works as Dependent
<3> The CounterApplication class operates in ApplicationScope

.IRedisStreamPipeConsumer.class
There is a more complex `IRedisStreamPipeConsumer`,
which is designed to allow extended stream consumption.
Compared to the `IRedisStreamConsumer` there are so many changes,
the return value of `Map<String, Object> onStream(StreamEntry streamEntry)` is
is the input of `void afterAck(StreamEntry streamEntry, Map<String, Object> onStreamResult)`.
The two functions run completely separate in their own requestScope.

In an EE environment, it is necessary to add other logic to the consumer,
such as the process identifier, unique metadata,
therefore it is recommended to use the
`hu.icellmobilsoft.coffee.module.redisstream.consumer.AbstractStreamConsumer`
which will prepare the implementing consumer.
This logic is used to send messages to the
`hu.icellmobilsoft.coffee.module.redisstream.publisher.RedisStreamPublisher`
class.
 
[source,java]
----
import javax.enterprise.inject.Model;
import javax.inject.Inject;

import hu.icellmobilsoft.coffee.dto.exception.BaseException;
import hu.icellmobilsoft.coffee.module.redisstream.annotation.RedisStreamConsumer;
import hu.icellmobilsoft.coffee.module.redisstream.consumer.AbstractStreamConsumer;

@Model
@RedisStreamConsumer(configKey = "redisConfigKey", group = "redisGroup")
public class SampleConsumer extends AbstractStreamConsumer {

    @Inject
    private Provider<Sample> sample;

    @Override
    public void doWork(String text) throws BaseException { // <1>
        sample.process(text);
    }
}
----
<1> The content can be string or json,
which from _StreamEntry_ is the value of the key RedisStreamConstant.Common#DATA_KEY_MAIN 

==== How does it work?

At application startup, for example (there are several options), it looks for the CDI `@Observes @Initialized(ApplicationScoped.class)` event
all classes that:

* `hu.icellmobilsoft.coffee.module.redisstream.consumer.IRedisStreamConsumer`
interface
* `hu.icellmobilsoft.coffee.module.redisstream.annotation.RedisStreamConsumer`
annotated with

From the annotation of the classes found, the redis connection key and the stream group name are known,
from which the name of the stream key and the settings are added.
It iterates through the classes and creates as many instances as each one is configured to create,
which it runs in separate threads using `hu.icellmobilsoft.coffee.module.redisstream.consumer.RedisStreamConsumerExecutor`.

In an infinite loop in each thread, the algorithm queries Redis for messages.
First it checks if there is a specified group and stream, if not it creates one.
In subsequent rounds it does not check this.
If a message is received, it creates an automatically handled RequestScope to execute the business:

. so that our usual RequestScope logic can be used to process the message
. each message is actually a real request, except that it does not come in REST
. this logic also follows the JMS scope handling

After successful message processing, it closes the RequestScope and issues the ACK command.

=== Starter

There are several ways to start a consumer,
CDI event, CDI extension, manual/delayed start, etc...

For these, a
`hu.icellmobilsoft.coffee.module.redisstream.bootstrap.BaseRedisConsumerStarter`
class and a
`hu.icellmobilsoft.coffee.module.redisstream.bootstrap.ConsumerStarterExtension`
CDI extension pattern (this can be a problem for example for JNDI bindings used in consumers)

WARNING: coffee does not start consumers by itself, this has to be done by everyone in the project based on their own needs. 

== Non-ACKed messages

This implementation does not deal with retrieved but not ACKed messages.
These need to be handled locally on a case by case basis as to what to do with them.
The `hu.icellmobilsoft.coffee.module.redisstream.service.RedisStreamService` class
contains query and handling methods for this purpose,
which can be used in the stuck business process.
