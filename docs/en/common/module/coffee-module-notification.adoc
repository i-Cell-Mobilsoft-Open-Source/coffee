[#common_module_coffee-module-notification]
= coffee-module-notification

Module for central management of notifications (email, push notification,...).

The module can be tightly coupled with the coffee-module-document module, from which it collects the messages and texts to be sent.
It not only handles the sending, but also stores who sent what, to whom, when and what.
Currently it can handle these notifications:

* email
* push notification

Includes a generic DTO submodule (optional) with predefined
communication objects.
