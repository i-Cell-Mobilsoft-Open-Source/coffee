The purpose of this module is to store and manage template texts. So if you have a SMS, Email,
PDF or other text to be filled with variable parameters in different languages,
this module will handle it.

It contains a generic DTO submodule (optional) in which are predefined
the communication objects. The working principle is to input the code of the template,
key-value pairs of parameters to be filled in, it is substituted into the template,
and return it in response. If not all the required parameters are entered, it loads the default values,
which are also stored in the module. The module is also capable of saving files,
but this is of limited use because it saves them to a database.
