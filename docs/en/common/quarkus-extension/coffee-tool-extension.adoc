[#common_coffee-quarkus-extensions-tool]
= coffee-tool-extension

The purpose of this module is to extend the `coffee-tool` module with Quarkus native runtime support.

The Quarkus native compiler (GraalVM) removes classes at build time that are not directly referenced.
This extension explicitly registers the classes referenced via reflection in the `coffee-tool` module, to prevent them from being removed by the compiler.

NOTE: currently, version 3.2.x of Quarkus is used in the extensions.

To use this module, you should add the extension dependency instead of `coffee-tool`, as it already includes the `coffee-tool` module.
