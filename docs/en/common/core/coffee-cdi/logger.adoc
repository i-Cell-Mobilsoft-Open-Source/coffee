= logger

Coffee uses its own logging system, for several reasons:

* wraps the actual logging system (currently it is java util log)
* collects all the logs that are logged at the request level,
logs all logging that is logged at the logging level, including logging that is not written to the console (or elsewhere) because logging is set to a higher level
(for example, if the root logger is set to INFO level, then the TRACE, DEBUG level log will not be output anywhere).
We are able to log these logs in case of an error to help the debugging process
* other information can be put into the log request level container
* check which level of log level is the highest logged

Each class has its own logger, loggers are not inheritable, not transferable. The CDI + jboss logger provides the basis for using it:

.sample use
[source,java]
----
// <1>
@Inject
@ThisLogger
private hu.icellmobilsoft.coffee.cdi.logger.AppLogger log;
  
  
// <2>
@Inject
private hu.icellmobilsoft.coffee.se.logging.Logger log;

// <3>
import hu.icellmobilsoft.coffee.cdi.logger.LogProducer;

public static String blabla() {
    LogProducer.getStaticDefaultLogger(BlaBla.class).trace("class blabla");
    LogProducer.getStaticDefaultLogger("BlaBla").trace("class name blabla");
    return "blabla";
}

// <4>
import hu.icellmobilsoft.coffee.se.logging.Logger;

public static String blabla() {
    Logger.getLogger(BlaBla.class).trace("class blabla");
    Logger.getLogger("BlaBla").trace("class name blabla");
    return "blabla";
}
----
<1> where we work with the class in @RequestScope (or higher scope) (90% of the cases)
<2> where there is no RequestScope
<3> where inject is not used, e.g. in static methods
<4> in JavaSE environments e.g. cliens jars

If a parameter is included in the logging, it should be placed between "[parameter]" characters EXCEPT.

.parameter logging pattern
[source,java]
----
log.trace("Generated id: [{0}]", id);
----

The purpose of this is to be able to immediately identify the variable value when looking at the log, and also if it has a value of "" (empty String) or null.
