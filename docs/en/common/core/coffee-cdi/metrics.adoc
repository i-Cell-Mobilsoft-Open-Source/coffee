[#common_core_coffee-cdi_metrics]
= Metrics

The internal logic of coffee has a metric implementation that is independent
and selectable within projects.
If no metric implementation is selected, then the default
`Noop*MetricsHandler` is activated in the system.

The choice of implementations can be found in the
<<common_module_coffee-module-mp-metrics,coffee-module-mp-metrics/micrometer>>
documentation.
