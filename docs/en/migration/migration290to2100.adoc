=== coffee-module-configdoc
The default behavior of documentation generation from configuration keys is reversed, fields do not need to be excluded from generation with the `@ConfigDoc(exclude = true)` annotation, but only fields marked with the `@ConfigDoc` annotation will be included in the generated file.

Where the `@ConfigDoc(exclude = true)` annotation was used, it can be removed, but where there was no annotation, the `@ConfigDoc` annotation must be added, otherwise, they will not be included in the generated documentation.
