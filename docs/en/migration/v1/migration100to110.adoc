* Updated mongo-java-driver (3.12.5).
* Introduction of CDI extension for dynamic MongoService production
* More efficient connection handling
* yml parameterization

MongoDbHandler deprecated, instead MongoDbClient or MongoService<T> extension can be used.

[source,java]
----
// old definition
@Inject
@MongoCustomConfiguration(databaseName = "database", urlKey = "urlKey")
private MongoDbHandler mongoDbHandler;

mongoDbHandler.setCollection("collection");
mongoDbHandler.insertOne(dtoDocument);
----

instead of using MongoDbClient

[source,java]
----
// new usage
@Inject
@MongoClientConfiguration(configKey = "configKey")
private MongoDbClient mongoDbClient;

mongoDbClient.initRepositoryCollection(collection);
mongoDbClient.insertOne(dtoDocument);
----

Using MongoService with POJO

[source,java]
----
// old definition
@Model
public class CustomMongoService extends MongoService<MongoEntity> {

    @Inject
    @MongoCustomConfiguration(databaseName = "database", urlKey = "urlKey")
    private MongoDbHandler mongoDbHandler;

    @Override
    protected MongoCollection<MongoEntity> getMongoCollection() throws BaseException {
        return mongoDbHandler.getDatabase().getCollection("collection", MongoEntity.class);
    }
}
    
@Inject
private CustomMongoService customMongoService;

----

instead of 

[source,java]
----
// new usage
@Dependent
public class CustomMongoService extends MongoService<MongoEntity> {
}

@Inject
@MongoServiceConfiguration(configKey = "configKey", collectionKey = "collectionKey")
private CustomMongoService customMongoService;
----
*Pagination*

Before using the MongoService find() method, *initRepositoryCollection(getMongoCollection())* must be called 
if not used with the new annotation.
[source,java]
----
// old definition
@Model
public class CustomMongoService extends MongoService<MongoEntity> {

    public PagingResult<MongoEntity> findByQueryParams(...) {
        ...
        // MongoService pagination find
        // initRepositoryCollection(getMongoCollection());
        find(filter, order, rows, page, InvoiceLog.class);
        ...
    }
}

@Inject
private CustomMongoService customMongoService;
----
 
Instead of using @MongoServiceConfiguration annotation, the collection is automatically loaded.
 
[source,java]
----
// old definition
@Dependent
public class CustomMongoService extends MongoService<MongoEntity> {

    public PagingResult<MongoEntity> findByQueryParams(...) {
        ...
        // MongoService pagination find
        find(filter, order, rows, page, InvoiceLog.class);
        ...
    }
}


@Inject
@MongoServiceConfiguration(configKey = "configKey", collectionKey = "collectionKey")
private CustomMongoService customMongoService;

=== Logging
The logging system used inside `AppLogger` has been changed from jboss to java.util.logging,
so that projects using coffee are not forced into a jboss environment.
At the same time, CDI independent classes have been outsourced to the `coffee-se-logging` module.
For the time being, backwards compatibility has been preserved, but deprecated, so you may want to switch as follows:

==== Migration


. jboss Logger inject
+
you can use your own coffee `hu.icellmobilsoft.coffee.se.logging.Logger` instead of the former jboss Logger.
Because of the class replacement, methods like `org.jobs.logging.Logger.tracev` must also be replaced with e.g. `hu.icellmobilsoft.coffee.se.logging.Logger.trace` (Logger default supports parameterization with MessageFormat)
+
NOTE: It still works with jboss Logger Inject, however this may change in later versions.
+
.Coffee 1.0.0
[source,java]
----
import org.jboss.logging.Logger;
...
    @Inject
    private Logger log;
...
log.tracev("Some traced log:[{0}]", param);
----
+
.Coffee 1.1.0+
[source,java]
----
import hu.icellmobilsoft.coffee.cdi.logger.AppLogger;
...
    @Inject
    private AppLogger log;
...
log.trace("Some traced log:[{0}]", param);
----


. static logger
+
The `LogProducer.getStaticLogger` has been deprecated and `LogProducer.getStaticDefaultLogger` can be used instead.
+
.Coffee 1.0.0
[source,java]
----
LogProducer.getStaticLogger(BlaBla.class).trace("class blabla");
----
+
.Coffee 1.1.0+
[source,java]
----
LogProducer.getStaticDefaultLogger(BlaBla.class).trace("class blabla");
----

=== MDC
MDC management is also handled through its own system;
where `org.jboss.logging.MDC` was used at project level until now,
you should change the import to `hu.icellmobilsoft.coffee.se.logging.mdc.MDC`. Read more: <<common_core_coffee-se_coffee-se-logging_MDC, MDC>>.

=== Sensitive logging
During logging, the default pattern used to mask sensitive data was too slow for large input sizes,
so it was replaced by a more optimal regex. The previous default pattern was `+++.*?(pass|secret).*+++?` instead:

* The `|` operator has been removed, instead it is possible to specify multiple patterns, which are checked one by one.
* The prefix and suffix `+++.*?+++` was unnecessarily generic, instead `+++[\w\s]*?+++` (`[a-zA-Z0-9_]` and whitespace) is sufficient.

Thus, the default patterns are `+++[\w\s]*?secret[\w\s]*?+++` and `+++[\w\s]*?pass[\w\s]*?+++`

The default pattern can still be overridden with the `coffee.config.log.sensitive.key.pattern` key based on mp-config.
Multiple patterns separated by commas(`,`) can be specified e.g. `+++[\w\s]*?secret[\w\s]*?,[\w\s]*?pass[\w\s]*?,[\w\s]*?login[\w\s]*?+++`

=== @Priority + @Alternative correction
In the project, @Alternative was incorrectly handled, specifically in these classes:

* AppLoggerNoContainerImpl (@Alternative for the AppLoggerImpl class)
* JsonRequestVersionReader (@Alternative to the EmptyRequestVersionReader class)
* XmlRequestVersionReader (@Alternative to EmptyRequestVersionReader class)
* XsdResourceResolver (@Alternative to PublicCatalogResolver class)

In all places @Alternative was only counted as a secondary input,
but @Priority changed them to primary.
The exception is `PublicCatalogResolver` where it was intended to be primary,
and this has now been moved as well.

If you still want to have one of the alternatives as primary then:

* local module: just activate it in the beans.xml file
* multi module project: create a new class, as in the following example

[source,java]
----
@Priority(100)
@Alternative
public class ProjectXsdResourceResolver extends XsdResourceResolver {
}
----
And you don't need beans.xml activation either


=== DefaultGeneralExceptionMapper

Refactored the `DefaultGeneralExceptionMapper` to include a set of if-else in both the `handleException` and `handleProductionStageException` methods.
These two have been merged, so that code must be modified in one place to handle new exceptions. At the same time, the `handleProductionStageException` method has been deleted,
instead, the logic to be executed on production can be redefined via consumer as required.
