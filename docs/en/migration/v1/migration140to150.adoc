= v1.4.0 â†’ v1.5.0

coff:ee v1.4.0 -> v1.5.0 migration description, new features, changes

== Changes

* Bump guava to 25.1 -> 29.0 - The update was triggered by https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-5mg8-w23w-74h3.
Since coff:ee only binds used dependencies,
had to enable the com.google.guava:failureaccess dependency,
which became mandatory with https://github.com/google/guava/releases/tag/v27.0:
https://groups.google.com/g/guava-announce/c/Km82fZG68Sw .
* Bump guava to 29.0 -> 30.1.1
* Bump commons-io 2.6 -> 2.8.0
* WildFly 23 compatibility

=== coffee-tool
Introduced the `StringUtil.maskUriAuthenticationCredentials` function.

Support for serialization/deserialization of durations in JsonUtil (DurationConverter.class) has been introduced.

Introduced several methods in `DateUtil` to help date management.

* `public static OffsetDateTime nowUTC()`
* ` `public static OffsetDateTime nowUTCTruncatedToMillis()`
* ` `public static LocalDate lastDayOfMonth(LocalDate baseDate)`
* ` `public static LocalDate lastDayOfQuarter(LocalDate baseDate)`
* ` `public static LocalDate lastDayOfYear(LocalDate baseDate)`
* ` `public static OffsetDateTime tryToParse(String isoDateTime)`
* ` `public static OffsetDateTime toOffsetDateTime(LocalDateTime localDateTime)`

==== Migration
As a result of the changes, the deserialisation of Duration Json has changed.
Previous format: "duration":{"signum":1, "years":1, "months":1, "days":1, "hours":1, "minutes":1, "seconds":1}
Current format: "duration": "P1Y1M1DT1H1M1S" (ISO 8601 standard)

This means that the change is not fully backwards compatible. Changes may result in migration work.
To help with the migration and to make it easier to understand, the documentation has been extended to include a description of 'Json support' in link:../common/core/coffee-rest.adoc[coffee-rest]

=== coffee-module-mongodb
Implemented the `StringUtil.maskUriAuthenticationCredentials` function in `MongoDbClientFactory.createMongoClient`.
for masking MongoDB uri when logging.

==== Migration
Changes do not result in migration work, backwards compatible.

=== coffee-module-redis
Introduced an optional version of *lpop* in the `RedisService` class,
and its counterpart *rpop*.

==== Migration
Changes do not result in migration work, backwards compatible.

=== coffee-module-redisstream
* The handling of the stream consumer has undergone further minor changes to make it easier to customize the project.
An `IRedisStreamPipeConsumer` has been created to allow extended stream consumption.
* RedisStreamConsumerExecutor has been brought to the MDC configuration level,
so that in the logging, the elapses are given the same sid.
Also a "retryCounter" MDC has been introduced,
which counts the number of iterations if there are more than one.
* A central role was given to `hu.icellmobilsoft.coffee.module.redisstream.common.RedisStreamPublication`
Stream message wrapper class, complete with TTL and custom message parameters
* Introduction of the `StreamMessageParameter.FLOW_ID_EXTENSION` message parameter,
which complements the SID logging.
