= v1.8.0 â†’ v1.9.0

coff:ee v1.8.0 -> v1.9.0 migration description, new features, changes

== What's new

=== JDK 17 support
The project now supports java 17,
so it can be used in this java based project.
Most of the problematic parts have been fixed with dependency updates,
the only problematic part is the use of gson.

.gson
This module is dependency reflection based (there are several official issues with this in the gson project),
which is restricted with java17 so configuration is required for test cases.
It is expected that the implemented project will also need the following jvm parameter:

[source,bash]
----
--add-exports=java.xml/com.sun.org.apache.xerces.internal.jaxp.datatype=ALL-UNNAMED
--add-opens=java.xml/com.sun.org.apache.xerces.internal.jaxp.datatype=ALL-UNNAMED
----
In future versions we will revise the dependency.

.java 11 && 17
The coff:ee 1.x.x will continue to be compiled with java 11,
but will also get compile and test checks for java 17.
This will minimize java version dependency problems.

==== BOM version elevations:
* google.code:gson 2.8.3 -> 2.8.9
* junit:jupiter 5.5.2 -> 5.8.1
* org.jboss.weld:weld-junit5 2.0.1.Final -> 2.0.2.Final
* jedis 3.6.0 -> 4.2.1


=== coffee-module-configdoc
* The module has been created
* Output file configurability

==== Migration
Changes do not result in migration work, backwards compatible.

=== coffee-tool
* DateXmlUtil -> XmlGregorianCalendar optimization: serving DatatypeFactory.newInstance() instance from cache for performance reasons

=== coffee-module-mongodb
* Retrieve cached instance of DatatypeFactory.newInstance() based on DateXmlUtil

==== Migration
Changes do not result in migration work, backwards compatible.

=== coffee-model-base
* Common generic interface fix for 2 `AbstractIdentifiedAuditEntity` classes (based on `java.util.Date` and `OffsetDateTime`) due to jackson deserialization bug. Separated `IAuditEntity` and `IIdentifiedEntity` interfaces.

==== Migration
Changes do not result in migration work, backwards compatible.

=== coffee-module-redis
* jedis version upgrade done 3.6.0 -> 4.2.1

==== Migration
Package changes have been made and should be followed

=== coffee-module-redisstream
* jedis version upgrade done 3.6.0 -> 4.2.1

==== Migration
Package changes have been made and need to be tracked

== Changes

=== General

==== Java EE 8 -> Jakarta EE 8 migration
First released Jakarta version is completely identical at package and class level
with the previous Java EE 8, differing only in maven coordinates.

==== Transition

* Replace the `javax` dependencies with https://wiki.eclipse.org/Jakarta_EE_Maven_Coordinates[corresponding
`jakarta` pair], for example:
+
.javax
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>.
    <groupId>javax</groupId>
    <artifactId>javaee-api</artifactId>
    <version>8.0</version>
    <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
----
+
.jakarta
[source,xml]
----

<dependency>
    <groupId>jakarta.platform</groupId>
    <artifactId>jakarta.jakartaee-api</artifactId>
    <version>8.0.0</version>
    <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
----
+
Or for separately managed dependencies:
+
.javax
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>.
    <groupId>javax.xml.bind</groupId>
    <artifactId>jaxb-api</artifactId>
    <version>2.3.1</version>
    <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
----
+
.jakarta
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>jakarta.xml.bind</groupId>
    <artifactId>jakarta.xml.bind-api</artifactId>
    <version>2.3.2</version>
    <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
----
+
* You should also check for dependencies that have been transitively pulled in, after the migration there should be no `javax` dependencies left in the project,
because this may result in unexpected errors. For this, you can use the `dependency:tree` goal of the maven dependency plugin.
It is possible that we have exploited the exclude-ed transitive dependency in code at project level, in which case a compilation error
which can be corrected by adding the `jakarta` pair of the exclude-olt `javax` artifact to the dependency.
