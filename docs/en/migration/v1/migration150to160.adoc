= v1.5.0 â†’ v1.6.0

coff:ee v1.5.0 -> v1.6.0 migration description, new features, changes

== Changes

* Bump Jedis 3.3.0 -> 3.6.0 - Native java 8 and Redis 6.2 support
* Bump apache httpcore 4.4.5 -> 4.4.13 - https://archive.apache.org/dist/httpcomponents/httpcore/RELEASE_NOTES-4.4.x.txt
* Bump apache httpclient 4.5.4 -> 4.5.13 - https://archive.apache.org/dist/httpcomponents/httpclient/RELEASE_NOTES-4.5.x.txt
* Release dependent scope objects created with `CDI#select`

=== coffee-module-redis
Redis 6.2 upgrade brought a change to change the timeout from int to long.
This has also been implemented in the system,
but since java handles the int->long type,
there is presumably no project code conflict.

Introduced functions:

* *lmove* - (Redis 6.2) one step POP + PUSH to another list
* *removeValueFromList* (*lrem*) - delete list item by value

==== Migration
Changes do not result in migration work, backwards compatible.

=== coffee-module-redisstream
* Renamed configuration key from `stream.maxlen` -> to `producer.maxlen`.
* The renamed `producer.maxlen` key had a default value of 1.000.000,
which has been removed, so if no configuration key is specified,
an infinite number of keys remain in the stream (within Redis limits).
* The `producer.ttl` key has been introduced,
which has a role in publishing a new message to the stream.
All older messages on the stream older than `producer.ttl` (millisec) will be deleted.

==== Migration
The renaming of the `stream.maxlen` key in the configurations must be rewritten.

=== coffee-rest
* RestClients return the error returned by the called module wrapped in `hu.icellmobilsoft.coffee.dto.exception.RestClientResponseException`, so for example the previously returned `hu.icellmobilsoft.coffee.dto.exception.BONotFoundException` is wrapped in the RestClientResponseException cause.
* The `hu.icellmobilsoft.coffee.rest.exception.DefaultExceptionMessageTranslator` recursively loads all cause values into `hu.icellmobilsoft.coffee.dto.common.commonservice.BaseExceptionResultType`.
* The value of the element "service" in the BaseExceptionResultType can be specified in the parameter "coffee.app.name", by default "java:app/AppName" is used.

==== Migration
* For error handling, a RestClientResponseException should be expected.
* The configuration parameter "coffee.app.name" can be set for the modules to be run, but is optional, "java:app/AppName" is the default.
