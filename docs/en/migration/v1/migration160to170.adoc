= v1.6.0 â†’ v1.7.0

coff:ee v1.6.0 -> v1.7.0 migration description, new features, changes

== What's new

=== coffee-module-ruleng
The `dispose` method in `AbstractEvaluator` has been redesigned,
by default, it does not destroy selected IRules because their scope is not known.
The `preDestroy` method has been introduced, which can be overridden to handle CDI destroy on rules at the project level.

==== Migration
If there was no `Dependent` implementation of the `IRule` interface,
changes do not result in migration work, it is backwards compatible.
Otherwise, `AbstractEvaluator.preDestroy` must be overwritten at the project level to release `Dependent` instances.

=== coffee-module-redis
RedisManager has been introduced.

* Unified error handling
* Unified connection handling
* Fully CDI Jedis management

RedisManager's run and runWithConnection methods have been @Traced annotated.

==== Migration
Changes do not result in migration work, backwards compatible.

=== coffee-jpa
In a batchService, it is possible that the array returned by executeBatch consists of fewer elements than the number of entities for which the batchService was run.
Previously, this was thrown with an `IllegalArgumentException`, this has been fixed, henceforth those records will be marked with `UNKNOWN` status,
for which no result was returned by executeBatch.

==== Migration
The changes do not result in any migration work, it is backwards compatible.

=== coffee-module-redisstream
* AbstractStreamConsumer.onStream method @Traced annotated
* AbstractStreamPipeConsumer.onStream method @Traced annotated

==== Migration
Changes do not result in migration work, backwards compatible.

=== coffee-cdi
* Traced annotation has been extended, span values can be specified for trace punctuation.
* Traced annotation moved to coffee-cdi module.

==== Migration
* Migration work in coff:ee resulted in 2 modules being connected, coffee-redis, coffee-redisstream
* Traced annotation import: hu.icellmobilsoft.coffee.module.mp.opentracing.extension -> hu.icellmobilsoft.coffee.cdi.trace.annotation

=== coffee-module-opentracing
* Redis operations and Redis stream consumers are channeled into the existing opentrace flow.

==== Migration
Changes do not result in migration work, backwards compatible.
