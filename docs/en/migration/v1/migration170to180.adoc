= v1.7.0 â†’ v1.8.0

coff:ee v1.7.0 -> v1.8.0 migration description, new features, changes

== What's new

* log level optimization


=== coffee-configuration
* Added module, separated from `coffee-rest` module
* `ConfigurationHelper` no longer uses `BaseRequestContainer` (thus eliminating double caching).
For config caching, `ApplicationConfiguration` is used, which uses guava caching.

==== Migration
* Imports must be rewritten from `hu.icellmobilsoft.coffee.rest.configuration` to `hu.icellmobilsoft.coffee.configuration`.


=== coffee-dto
* The UtcOffsetDateTimeXmlAdapter and the UtcOffsetTimeXmlAdapter have been created.
* The `user` field has been removed from `ContextType` and UUIDs can be specified in `requestId`.

==== Migration
* The `user` field has been removed from `ContextType` and the `UserType` in `commonservice` has been removed. References to these should be removed.

== Changes

=== General

==== BOM version elevations:
* microprofile-config-api 1.3 -> 2.0
* smallrye-config 1.7.0 -> 2.8.1
* opencsv 3.9 -> 5.5.2

=== coffee-module-etcd
* jetcd-core version update <version>0.5.0</version> -> <version>0.6.1</version>

==== Migration
Changes do not result in migration work, backwards compatible.

=== coffee-rest
* The value that can be specified in the "coffee.app.name" parameter is no longer mandatory, "java:app/AppName" is used by default.
* Addition of unmarshalXML methods to JaxbTool to receive `byte[]`
* Create DefaultBaseExceptionMapper to handle built-in BaseExceptions

==== Migration
* The deprecated InvalidRequestException and SaxParseBaseException have been removed, instead the use of XsdProcessingException is recommended
* Migration to DefaultBaseExceptionMapper. If there is a project specific exception that you want to handle, you can
you need to extend the mapper as follows:
[source,java]
----
@Provider // <1>
@Dependent
public class BaseExceptionMapper extends DefaultBaseExceptionMapper {

    @Override // <2>
    protected Response handleException(BaseException e) {
        if (e instanceof SampleException) {
            return createResponse(e, Response.Status.BAD_REQUEST, new BusinessFault());
        }

        return super.handleException(e);
    }
}
----
<1> @Provider is required to extend the DefaultBaseExceptionMapper
<2> handleException @Override if project specific exception mapping is required

=== coffee-jpa
* The `BatchService` automatically sets the version of the passed entities

==== Migration
* If the version has been manually incremented after a batch save, it must be removed


=== coffee-model-base
* The 2 `AbstractIdentifiedAuditEntity` classes (based on `java.util.Date` and `OffsetDateTime`) have been given a common generic interface

==== Migration
The changes do not result in migration work, backwards compatible.


=== coffee-module-localization
* The module has been created, separated from the `coffee-rest` module

==== Migration
* Imports need to be rewritten from `hu.icellmobilsoft.coffee.rest.locale` to `hu.icellmobilsoft.coffee.module.localization`.


=== coffee-module-csv
* opencsv upgrade 3.9 -> 5.5.2
* impelmenting csvUtil localization management

==== Migration
* replace `@CsvBind` annotations with `@CsvBindByNamePosition`

=== coffee-module-redisstream
* `RedisStreamConsumerExecutor` now logs all `Throwable`, not just `Exception`

==== Migration
Changes do not result in migration work, backwards compatible.

=== coffee-module-mongodb
* Using `MongoDbClient` with `@MongoClientConfiguration` qualifier no longer requires the request scope to be active

==== Migration
Changes do not result in migration work, backwards compatible.
