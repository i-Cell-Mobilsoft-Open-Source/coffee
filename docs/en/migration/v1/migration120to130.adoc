more info in the description

== Changes

=== coffee-dto
* Added SimpleText1024NotBlankType type in common.xsd.

==== Transition

Changes do not result in migration work, backwards compatible.

=== coffee-model

* The `modificationDate` field of audited entities is not auto-filled on creation, only on modification.

==== Migration

Changes do not result in migration work, backwards compatible.

=== coffee-jpa
* Replace `List` types as input in BatchService class with `Collection`.

==== Migration

Changes do not result in migration work, backwards compatible.

=== coffee-rest

* `RequestResponseLogger#printEntity(byte[], Integer, String)` correctly returns the log message if the byte array parameter (entity) is null or empty.
* `RequestResponseLogger#printEntity` has been fixed to truncate the last character in LogSpecifier.UNLIMIT (this is the default)
* `CoffeeFaultType.INVALID_XML` localisation has been rewritten

==== Migration

Changes do not result in migration work, backwards compatible.

=== coffee-module-mp-restclient

* `DefaultLoggerClientResponseFilter#logEntity` logs correctly if there is no entity in the response.
* `RestClientPriority#REQUEST_LOG` priority Priorities.AUTHENTICATION -> Priorities.HEADER_DECORATOR + 100, so trace information is logged.
* Automatic detection of enums implementing `IFaultType` with `FaultTypeParserExtension`. This makes it possible to map error responses to an exception with the corresponding FaultCode.

==== Migration

The changes do not result in any migration work, it is backwards compatible.
To find `IFaultType` implementations, you may need to include `beans.xml` in the module of the enum to be recognized at the project level.

=== coffee-module-redis
* jedis update 3.1.0 -> 3.3.0

==== Migration
Changes do not result in migration work, backwards compatible.

=== coffee-module-etcd
* `etcd.default.url` -> `coffee.etcd.default.url` configuration key change.
* `EtcdRepository` and `ConfigEtcdService` have been reworked to be used
non-CDI locations (e.g. MP-ConfigSource, test), have been given separate CDI producers. 
* Introduction of `hu.icellmobilsoft.coffee.module.etcd.producer.CachedEtcdConfigSource` config source,
see <<Microprofile-config>>
* Minor logging optimization.
* `hu.icellmobilsoft.coffee.module.etcd.service.BaseEtcdService` deprecated.
The structure was very old and the initial concept did not fit the Microprofile-Config
principles of Micro-Config.
Its full-fledged replacement is the `hu.icellmobilsoft.coffee.module.etcd.service.EtcdService` class,
which works explicitly with String values.

==== Migration
The `etcd.default.url` key included in the configuration must be supplemented with the prefix `coffee.`.
It is recommended to use the config source `hu.icellmobilsoft.coffee.module.etcd.producer.CachedEtcdConfigSource`.

=== coffee-module-opentracing
* New module, more info in the description.

=== coffee-cdi
* New annotation: `hu.icellmobilsoft.coffee.cdi.trace.annotation.Traceable`, see description for details.

=== coffee-tool
* Introduction and use of `hu.icellmobilsoft.coffee.tool.utils.string.RegexPatternCache` in the `StringUtil` class in the
class to optimize regular expressions.

==== Migration
This change does not result in any migration work, it is backwards compatible.

=== coffee-module-redis
* The hscan operation can be parameterized with count. 

==== Migration
The change does not result in any migration work, backwards compatible.
