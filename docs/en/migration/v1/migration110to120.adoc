coff:ee v1.1.0 -> v1.2.0 migration description, news, changes

== Changes

=== coffee-cdi
* In LogContainer, when specifying different log levels, only Varargs (multiple arguments) is retained among the multiple argument options for formatted messages.
* LogContainer's logs automatically get a LocalDateTime.now() when they are created, which is also printed when logs are written.
* In LogContainer, when a Throwable is written, the message received in the argument is now also written, and the stacktrace is written in a more structured way.

==== Transition

Changes do not result in migration work, backwards compatible.

=== coffee-dto
* In common.xsd, the regex describing the TimestampType type has been extended, it can now accommodate fractional seconds with 6 digits precision instead of the previous 3.

* RequestResponseLogger response printout extended with xml printout if mediaType is application/xml,text/xml or application/atom+xml.

* For RequestResponseLogger response printout, in all other non-string object cases, the response object is printed using the toString() method of the object.
* The BaseServicePath class has been moved to the coffee-dto package.
* ApplicationConfiguration - if no value is found for the configuration key - now only logs a WARN line, without stacktrace.
* All methods of JsonMessageBodyReaderBase can be extended.

==== Migration
