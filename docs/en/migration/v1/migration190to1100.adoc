= v1.9.0 â†’ v1.10.0

coff:ee v1.9.0 -> v1.10.0 migration description, news, changes

== Changes

=== General

==== BOM version upgrades:
* mongo-java-driver 3.12.5 -> mongodb-driver-sync 4.5.1
* apache deltaspike 1.9.1 -> 1.9.6

=== coffee-module-mongodb
* replaced mongo-java-driver with the new mongodb-driver-sync
* the `heartbeatConnectTimeout` and `heartbeatSocketTimeout` parameters have been removed from the configuration, as the new api does not support setting them directly. Their values will be identical to `connectTimeout` and `socketTimeout`.
* mongo import changes

==== Migration
* the `heartbeatConnectTimeout` and `heartbeatSocketTimeout` parameters can be deleted from the configuration
* the `com.mongodb.util` package is no longer available, the `Util` class in it has no replacement. If there is a reference to the included `JSON` class, serialization and de-serialization can be replaced by the corresponding methods of `BasicDBObject` (`parse`, `toJson`)
* More information about the changes: https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/java/sync/current/legacy/#api-changes

=== coffee-jpa
* `BatchService` already handles time types well if `hibernate.jdbc.time_zone` is set in `persistence.xml`.

==== Migration
The changes do not result in any migration work, it is backwards compatible.

=== coffee-module-configdoc
* Configuration document generation option for dynamic keys.

==== Migration
Changes do not result in migration work, backwards compatible.

=== coffee-module-redis
* Added `@Disposes` to `RedisManagerProducer`, dependent beans caused memory leaks.
* `RedisService`, `RedisRepository` has been removed (as it is incompatible with the new 4.2.1 jedis)
* jedis upgrade `4.2.1` -> `4.2.3`

==== Migration
* `RedisService` replaced by `RedisManager`. E.g.:
[source,java]
----
redisService.getRedisData("key", String.class);
----
->
[source,java]
----
redisManager.runWithConnection(Jedis::get, "get", "key");
----

=== coffee-module-redisstream
* `RedisStreamHandler` renamed to `RedisStreamPublisher` to make the purpose of the class clear
* `RedisStreamPublisher` and `RedisStreamService` have been changed to `RedisManager`, so the publish methods return `Optional`.
* `RedisStreamPublisher` and `RedisStreamPublication` moved to ` hu.icellmobilsoft.coffee.module.redisstream.publisher` package
* The `RedisManagerConnection` class has been created to simplify the closing of `RedisManager` connections

==== Migration
* Rename `RedisStreamHandler` to `RedisStreamPublisher`
* Rename `hu.icellmobilsoft.coffee.module.redisstream.common` package to `hu.icellmobilsoft.coffee.module.redisstream.publisher`
* Where the return value of the `RedisStreamPublisher` and `RedisStreamService` methods is used, handle `Optional`

=== coffee-dto-base
* In the `UtcOffsetDateTimeXmlAdapter` class, if the second was zero it was truncated, this has been fixed.

==== Migration
The changes do not result in any migration work, backwards compatible.

=== coffee-module-configdoc
* Extract the contents of the `@since` tag from javadoc and display it in a new column
* Configure the columns to be displayed in the generated table and their order (e.g. `-Acoffee.configDoc.columns=key,since,description`)

==== Migration
Changes do not result in migration work, backwards compatible.
