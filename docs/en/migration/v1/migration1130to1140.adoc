== What's new

No new features have been implemented in this version.

== Changes


=== coffee-jpa

* `BaseService` `repositoryFailed` method `java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: can't parse argument number: explicit` caused an error for `org.hibernate.QueryException` with a message containing a bracket (e.g. `fetched association was not present in the select list [FromElement{explicit,not a collection join`). The `MessageFormat.format` detected that there was a parameter placeholder and tried to insert a value in its place.
The error was handled by adding a new param placeholder with a local value of `params.length` to the message and appending the value of the Exception `getLocalizedMessage` to the original parameter array.

==== Migration

The changes do not result in any migration work, it is backwards compatible.
