coff:ee v1.10.0 -> v1.11.0 migration description, new features, changes

== Changes

=== coffee-module-redis

* *JedisDataException has been wrapped into TechnicalException*, so old logic couldn't handle it, so it's in *cause*
in *JedisDataException* had to be modified to handle the flow.
* In `RedisStreamConsumerExecutor`, `handleGroup` closed the jedis connection that `consumeOne` would have used,
so an exception was thrown.
* Introduced the poolConfigKey option in the Redis connection settings.

==== Migration

Since the Redis keying option has changed,
so you have to change the "default" group in the project configuration.
Other changes will not result in a migration, they are backwards compatible.

=== coffee-module-redis-stream

* `coffee.redisstream.{0}.producer.{1}` configuration keys not valid, fixed

==== Migration

Changes do not result in migration work, backwards compatible.

=== coffee-module-mp-opentracing

* *OpenTraceErrorResponseFilter* NPE error thrown when request in filter chain was stuck before opentrace filter, which could not generate
spans, e.g. if an unexpected error occurs during authentication is such a case, since auth is usually at a higher priority than opentrace.
The error has been handled, we only log cases where we can't add to the trace flow because it doesn't exist.


==== Migration

The changes do not result in any migration work, backwards compatible.

=== coffee-rest
* Added a default OpenApiFilter that can be activated with the following configuration:
[source,properties]
----
mp.openapi.filter=hu.icellmobilsoft.coffee.rest.filter.OpenAPIFilter
----

==== Migration
The changes do not result in migration work, it is backwards compatible.

=== coffee-cdi
* Deltaspike dependencies removed, moved to coffee-module-localization module. Along with this, `LogProducer.getAppLogger()` has been removed,
instead, `LogProducer.logToAppLogger(...)` is now usable, expects a functional interface and class, handles AppLogger creation and termination by itself.
* Methods previously deprecated from `LogProducer` are deprecated and replaced by `Logger.getLogger(...)`:
** createDefaultJbossLogger(InjectionPoint injectionPoint)
** getStaticLogger(Class<?> clazz)
** getStaticLogger(String className)
** getStaticDefaultLogger(Class<?> clazz)
** getStaticDefaultLogger(String className)
* Dependencies are removed:
** deltaspike-core-api
** deltaspike-core-impl

==== Migration
Since coffee-cdi no longer pulls in the deltaspike dependencies, you need to add them in the project pom.xml.
