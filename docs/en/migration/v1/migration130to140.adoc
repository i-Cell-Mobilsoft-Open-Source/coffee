= v1.3.0 â†’ v1.4.0

coff:ee v1.3.0 -> v1.4.0 migration description, new features, changes

== Changes

=== coffee-model-base

* Fields `creationDate`, `creatorUser` of audited entities have been changed to `updatable = false` property,
so that in the future they will not be included in the SQL run by hibernate when updating.

==== Migration

If there is an entity where the fields are overwritten on a record that has already been saved, the overwritten values will no longer be saved to the database, if this is still required, you will need to implement your own `AbstractAuditEntity` at the project level.

== coffee-module-redisstream
The Consumer *retryCount* option has been introduced as `@RedisStreamConsumer` in the configuration.

==== Migration
The changes do not result in migration work, backwards compatible.

=== coffee-module-redis
Introduced the *lpop* operation to the `RedisService` class.
The *rpushRedisData* operation in the `RedisService` class now returns the list size.

==== Migration
Changes do not result in migration work, backwards compatible.
